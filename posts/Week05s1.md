**Assignment Task**

After finalize the icon design, I filter our every icon sketch and start designing every icon using Adobe Illustrator that represent my website service. All the nine (9) icon will have a duplicate design after hover the mouse to make it moving/slightly different than the originals one. All the icon need to be in the flat design.

From the icon traced and design using Adobe Illustrator, I'll start colouring one of the icon with one (1) hue and then adds another (1) hue to play with the icon design. I'll keep playing with the colour design untill we come out with 16 colour design.

Then, I choose the colour base on Analogous colour theory, which focusing on Yellow, Green and Gray. Some of the colour was changed using saturation and value to give more variety of colour using one Hue.
