### Assignment Task

As the greybox layout object been replaced with the asset. We need to add Mech Collider tool to ensure the character control not going through the asset when the gameplay is active.

This tool will keep the character control move smoothly and follow the path created along the journey planned.

For this layout, there gonna be four (4) gates/entrance to make sure the player know where the character enter the area/zone of the game. In this case, i'm using the old traditional Malaysia gate as a reference an create it using Blender software. To differentiate each zone, I create a signboard below it and named it based on the zone their enter.
