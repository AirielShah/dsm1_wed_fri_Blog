Week 7, session 2!

### Class Task

**Terrain tutorial tool**

To get started with the Assignment 3 Environment Design, we learn to create a base of the map using terrain tool and paint the texture of the terrain. Once we get to know the steps of the tutorial, it can be applied into our assignment and start develop the map of our design.
