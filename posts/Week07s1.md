Week 7, session 1!

### Class Task

**Setting up Unity software**

As the upcoming task, we were told to use the Unity software for Assignment 3 - Digital 3D Environment Design. The software might be a little bit difficult for me as the task require to create a 3D asset and model. The first experience in handling 3D software was a bit struggle and interesting.

In getting familiar with the system, we were told to experiment with the tools and create a geometrical shapes of object and placed on the plane (surface) as a model.

### Assignment Task

The idea of this 3D Digital Environment Design is to create something meaningful change or transformation experience that I have undergone. The idea of this was to experience how the phase of grief/depression was passed by. The Map will be divided into several phases of the journey that most teenagers undergo when they get older.

The first phase will be The Journey Beach, which translates into the new beginning of the journey. The second phase will be The Depression Forest, where the story of life getting into crisis/issues. Next will be The Redemption City, which will be the phase of redemption for what we get into trouble for. Last but not least, The Glory Mountain, where everyone puts their hope and strives for their achievement.

Below are the suggestion on how the Map Layout would be looks like.
