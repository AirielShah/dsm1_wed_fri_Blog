First Week session 1!
Let's go scavanger hunt with us

---

## The task is to find the following hint places and take a group selfie as evidence.

1. An explosive cup of coffee.
2. A book containing Digital Media wisdom, found amongst many.
3. A wide net strung above, bulging under the weight of its flying paper cargo.
4. A curtain of roots, delivered by a winged visitor.
5. A door for the condemned.
6. A study space fit for a Sith Lord.
7. The disembodied hands of a great ape.
8. A basement-dwelling Black Box, bigger than you might think.
9. A wide machine, dispensing beverages from a far away land.
10. A golden globe atop a tower of eights.

## Let's see what we discover.



## That is all from today's scavenger hunt.

Here is the 30-second clip for my interest.
