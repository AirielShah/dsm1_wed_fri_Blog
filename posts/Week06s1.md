Sixth Week session 1!

**Class Task**

*Audio recording session*

To make the icon more interactive other than changing design when hove. Putting some audio in each icon when clicking the icon can give an impact to users.

From the screen shot above, we record some audio and edit it using Adobe Audition to enhance the volume and reduce the noise background. After selected the part of the audio, we save it in mp3 format to be used in icon design.

**Assignment Task**

After the colour arrangement on one icon, I'll continue with others icon design using the same colour pallet. The ideas is to have a simmilar profile of icon for the website.

I'll keep revisit the mindmap to keep the platform, context and audience of my ideas in the same planning as my brainstorming. Some adjustment was made to reflect the project development.
