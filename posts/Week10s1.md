Week 10, session 1!

### Class Task

**Self reflection question and answer**

In this class session, we are instruct to answer the reflective questions based on the previous assignment. In pairs, we will ask the questions and answer the question like the mock interview as our first draft on final website reflection. Here are the following questions and answer we did through the class.

**Assignment 1: Self-Portrait video**

Questions 1: How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of your edit?
***Answer: To achieve the relationship between sound design and video elements, I came up with a solution to use diegetic sound in the video to enhance its meaning. But, I also need to ensure that the music I choose does not interfere with the clarity of the other key scenes.*** 

Questions 2: How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?
***I need to construct the storyboard first to determine the scene I need to record. Some scenes require more footage or angles to make the video more realistic and have the element of continuity.***

Questions 3: What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how did you apply this knowledge to your project?
***The power of sound design can influence emotional experience. It can evoke some memories like nostalgia, suspense or joy through the video plays. By using this knowledge, I can apply it to my project making it more impactful to the viewers.***

Questions 4: How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of the time in the project?
***Through the process of editing techniques such as cuts, transitions and timing adjustment, we can control the pacing and rhythm of our project. It can help us to see how these concepts can be used in the duration of shots, the placement of scenes and the tempo of the overall narrative.***

As the time was short to answer the rest of the followings questions, we were ask to continue this Q&A session as our homeworks.

### Assignment Task

From the class session today, here are the rest of the Q&A session relating on the Assignment 2 & 3 that will be used in the developement of Assignment 4.


**Assignment 2: Flat icon design**

Questions 1: How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose the theme that you did?
***I designed a suite of icons based on the theme of the future and connectivity. Each icon represents different ways people interact and connect, reflecting our interconnected world. I chose this theme to celebrate the diverse ways people dream of futurism and collaborate, using various symbols to create a versatile set for different contexts.***

Questions 2: Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?
***I chose the design that best captured the essence of connectivity and futurism while maintaining visual coherence and versatility. This involved selecting symbols and visual elements that were universally recognizable and designing them in a way that felt cohesive as a set. Additionally, I considered feedback from my classmates and lecturer to ensure the final design met their needs and expectations.***

Questions 3: How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator? Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?
***In Illustrator, I traced over my thumbnail sketches, refining the shapes, adding color, and fine-tuning details. While some hand-drawn charm may have been lost, the digital process allowed for precision and scalability, making the icons more consistent and suitable for various uses.***

Questions 4: How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?
***In both audio and visual design, we use similar principles to create engaging experiences. We balance elements, create contrast for interest, and focus attention on key points. We also consider rhythm, proportion, and harmony to make compositions feel cohesive and pleasing. So, even though we're working with different senses, the goals and techniques are similar.***


**Assignment 3: 3D Virtual Environment**

Questions 1: How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that process?
***Having a working prototype in 3D environment design is really important. It helps designers see and interact with their ideas, making it easier to spot problems and get feedback early on. With a prototype, designers can try out different solutions and make sure the final design meets everyone's needs.***

Questions 2: How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional media?
***Designing and producing a three-dimensional environment differs from working in two-dimensional media primarily in terms of dimensionality, complexity, interactivity, technical requirements, and workflow. In 3D design, the focus shifts to thinking in three dimensions, which introduces complexities related to modeling, texturing, lighting, and animation.***

Questions 3: What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?
***The virtual camera in my 3D project was like a real camera in digital video; it framed shots, controlled focus and movement, and captured scenes. However, it operated within a computer-generated environment, offering more control over aspects like movement and perspective. Unlike a traditional camera, it allowed interactive exploration of the 3D space, letting users navigate and view scenes from different angles.***

Questions 4: What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldnâ€™t have discovered otherwise?
***Through playtesting in 3D design, I discovered how users interacted with the environment, identifying usability issues, improving feedback mechanisms, optimizing performance, uncovering emergent gameplay opportunities, and understanding user preferences better.***
