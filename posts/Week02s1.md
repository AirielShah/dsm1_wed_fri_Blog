Second Week session 1!

**Class Task**

*Storyboard making process*

For this task, we were taught to create a storyboard from any movie/scene. From that movie, we need to try to create a storyboard for each scene and understand the composition/camera angle.

**Assignment Task**

To create a **storyboard** and develop a **storyline** for your Assignment 1

Using footage shot by you on a smartphone, create a video self-portrait that connects a series of places, objects, events, and people — and thus the ideas and meanings that they represent — through simple editing techniques. The portrait can either be reflective, and offer a snapshot of your personality, interests, and feelings as you enter into the program, or aspirational, and seek to paint a picture of who you hope to be in a few years time. In either case, you are limited to the following editing techniques:

Fade to black/white.
Cut.
Crossfade/dissolve. 
Adjustment of audio levels and equalisation.
Fade audio in/out.

All footage for this project must be shot by you, should be of a consistent quality, shot landscape, and cannot feature any filters or effects. While the majority of this footage should be shot specifically for this project, you are able to use existing footage if it would be otherwise difficult to obtain. You may appear at certain points throughout the portrait, however most of the meaning should derive from your connecting of different images, sounds, and ideas through your editing.

Here are the storyline:

Scene 1: A clip represents my journey to a new place starting a huge impact on my life.
Scene 2: Being in the beautiful city of Melbourne for the first time.
Scene 3: Finding a culture that's come from my origin country to feels like home.
Scene 4: Looking out for my interest in art and design.
Scene 5: Finding myself recording and portraying in the frame.
Scene 6: Hanging around the Cafe and enjoy doing my stuff.
Scene 7: Exploring the city and finding a new place for Instagram pictures.
Scene 8: Walking at the beach and finding comfort.
Scene 9: Hanging around with friends to share a story.
Scene 10: Capture some birds flying free in the sky.
Scene 11: Ending the video with sunset.

For the storybords, will share to you on next week class session.
