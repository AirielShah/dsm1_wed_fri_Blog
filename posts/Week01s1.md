# Class Task

Let's go scavanger hunt with us

---

## The task is to find the following hint places and take a group selfie as evidence.

1. An explosive cup of coffee.
2. A book containing Digital Media wisdom, found amongst many.
3. A wide net strung above, bulging under the weight of its flying paper cargo.
4. A curtain of roots, delivered by a winged visitor.
5. A door for the condemned.
6. A study space fit for a Sith Lord.
7. The disembodied hands of a great ape.
8. A basement-dwelling Black Box, bigger than you might think.
9. A wide machine, dispensing beverages from a far away land.
10. A golden globe atop a tower of eights.

# Let's see what we discover.

It's quite hard to find the Cafe, as we need to ask some others barista to guide us. Luckily, we find it!

Next stop! We're going to the library, It's so big!!

Find it outside the library, got lucky actually.

Cannot find the fourth hint, so sad :(

Need to walk a little bit farther to the Alumni Gardens/Park to find it.

Not far from the Library area, who is the Star Wars Fan?!!

Found this at Bowen Street, nice sculpture btw.

Not sure if this is the right place, but there is the black box!

![The ninth stop of Scavenger Hunt](/images/09.jpg)
Getting thirsty while searching, why not buy some drinks first?

![The tenth stop of Scavenger Hunt](/images/10.jpg)
The only tower that had a gold globe in the area. There are some number 8 on top of the tower.
